# Spam Email Classification using Machine Learning

This project aims to classify emails into spam or ham using machine learning techniques. The model was developed using Python with text preprocessing and TF-IDF feature extraction.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle
- Total data: 5,000 emails

## Methodology
1. Data preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)
2. Feature extraction using TF-IDF
3. Model evaluation using accuracy and F1-score

## Model
- Algorithm: Logistic Regression

## Evaluation
- Accuracy: 97%
- F1-score: 86%

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Trying different classification algorithms
